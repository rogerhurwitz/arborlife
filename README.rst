Arbor Life
==========
Arbor Life is a strategy game that combines a captivating storyline with
educational detail about the forest ecosystem. The game is set in the
competition of the natural world where the player starts out by taking the
identity of an individual tree, assuming control of its survival strategy.
They’ll make decisions that ultimately determine whether their tree thrives
and reproduces in a continually shifting environment of threats,
opportunities, and competition.

Game Overview
=============
Based on a realistic simulation reflecting the many ways in which trees are
able to respond to their environment, every decision the player makes comes
with both potential payoffs and risks.

At the start of the game, the player chooses a tree species and a habitat for
it to grow. The tree, guided by their decisions, will look and behave in a way
that’s natural for that species. And each habitat – a forest, a savannah, an
open meadow – will come with its own unique set of challenges.

As the game unfolds, the player’s tree will compete for resources in the soil
and sunlight in the sky as they navigate threats and opportunities for
survival.

Game Initiation
---------------
- Player chooses habitat and tree species.
- Simulation determines terrain and surrounding habitat of player’s tree,
  including species and genetic characteristics of the player’s and competing
  trees.
- Player sets seasonal characteristics of their tree.
- Player chooses initial allocations of energy produced.
- Simulation determines initial allocations of stored energy for surrounding
  trees.

Dynamic Simulation
------------------
- The moment to moment simulation of the forest environment: weather and soil
  conditions, threats, tree growth/changes, tree damages, photosynthetic
  production.

Choices and End Game
--------------------
- Player at any time can change  the rate of game time relative to real time.
- Player at any time can update their tree’s energy allocation.
- Player can update seasonal and other tree characteristics.
- Player can view tree metrics and forest rankings.
- Game ending depends on scenario.
