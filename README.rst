arborlife
=========

arborlife is an open source forest-centric simulation library intended for use
by educators and studuents, or anyone else for that matter with an interest in
tree-stuff.  The goal is to model the real-life processes associated with
forests accurately enough to be educational, and perhaps even fun.  The
theoretical foundation for arborlife comes from the work of Neil Hurwitz.

arborlife is at a VERY early stage of development - really just bits and pieces
to be honest.  Stick around if you want to hack on it with us, or come back
later when we (hopefully) have something real for you to play with.

NOTE: The master branch of this repository tracks the very latest development
and may contain features and changes that do not exist on any released version.
